1.You'll need a UNIX based OS.
2.You can download Ubuntu from https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
3.You can also use PUTTY Or NoMachine for the connection to the remote server.Generally, all the school's has its own servers.

NOTE: The client should be on the same server(alpha.cs.uwindsor.ca).


Step for Execution, if you are using it on your school's server.I am running it on University of Windsor's server as an example.

Unix Server:

1. Compile the unix server file on alpha.cs.uwindsor.ca (University of Windsor's server) using gcc calcyServer.c -o server.exe 
2. Execute the file as ./server.exe 12345 where the port number is 12345.
3. Now when the server is up compile the client.

Unix Client:

1. Compile the unix client file on alpha.cs.uwindsor.ca (University of windsor's server) using gcc calcyClient.c -o client.exe 
2. Execute the file as ./client.exe 12345 137.207.82.51 where the port number is 12345 and 137.207.82.51 is the IP address for alpha server.
3. Now when the client is connected with the server, Sever will indicate by displaying a message.
4. Now you can, interact with the server.
5. Example: You can type 3+4 and server will return 7 as an answer.
